	/**
	 * Backward compatibility for values a block keeps in its ROOT attributes.
	 *
	 * Content authored before the per-device store existed holds its values as
	 * plain root attributes — `{"sliderHeight":"500px"}` — with no
	 * `responsiveControls` and no `style` viewport states. Nothing rewrites post
	 * content on upgrade (see `LegacyStore`: "content is normalised as it is
	 * read rather than migrated in the database"), so the render path has to
	 * read that shape, and `get_device_attributes()` resolves each device from
	 * the store alone. A root-only value therefore never reached the CSS
	 * pipeline and the generator fell back to the attribute default: a slider
	 * authored at 500px rendered `height: auto`, arrows moved from 30px to 1px,
	 * a Content block's text shadow produced no rule at all. Measured against
	 * 1.0.6, which read root attributes directly.
	 *
	 * This used to be driven by a hand-written list of four blocks and six
	 * attributes, extended one bug report at a time — which is why a slider's
	 * `background` survived while `sliderHeight` on the same block did not. The
	 * list is now the block's OWN declaration: every attribute it registers with
	 * `ResponsiveAttributeCSS` is bridged, so all 95 unbridged keys across 22
	 * blocks are covered by one rule instead of 22 map entries. The same rule
	 * already existed for the preview path in
	 * `convert_attrs_to_responsive_controls()`; this is the render path catching
	 * up with it.
	 *
	 * The per-ATTRIBUTE guard below is what makes it safe, and it must stay per
	 * attribute rather than "only when the store is empty" — the shape the
	 * preview helper uses. On 7.1 the root attribute is the editor's routing
	 * scratch, holding whatever device was edited last, so promoting it when
	 * some viewport already authored the key would write a mobile keystroke into
	 * the desktop layer. Asking per key means a viewport override always wins
	 * and the root is consulted only where no device has an opinion.
	 *
	 * Ordering matters and is already correct: this runs on `render_block_data`
	 * at priority 5, after `LegacyStore::normalize_device_keys()` at 3 and
	 * `build_store_from_style()` at 4, so the guard sees the `lg`/`md`/`sm`
	 * buckets and core's viewport states before it decides.
