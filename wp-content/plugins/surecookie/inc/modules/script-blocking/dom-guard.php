/**
 * DOM guard injection.
 *
 * The tag-level passes in Blocker only ever see the HTML WordPress sent, so a
 * tracker that a page builder, lazy-loader or tag manager builds in the browser
 * loads no matter what the visitor chose. This prints a small script at the very
 * top of `<head>` that intercepts the assignment of a URL to a `<script>` or
 * `<iframe>` and parks it in the same `data-surecookie-*` shape the PHP blocker
 * produces, so consentManager.js restores it on accept with no extra plumbing.
 *
 * Injected into the buffer rather than hooked onto `wp_head`, because a theme or
 * plugin can print a tag manager into `<head>` before any hook fires; the only
 * reliable "first" is the top of the finished document.
 *
 * The payload is consent-agnostic (patterns only), so it is safe to serve from a
 * full-page cache. The guard reads the consent cookie itself at runtime.
